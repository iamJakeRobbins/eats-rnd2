Running Tally: 1.75hrs
* What are we doing here?

I've already built eats once, the project is over and its time to move on to other things.  But I didn't finish things entirely.  I ran out of time and there were things that I didn't have sufficient mastery over to execute efficiently.  

So I'm going to start over; using what I learned to build the project better, faster, stronger etc.  The goal is to hone my ability to effectively use my time, and to create a blueprint for approaching future projects in a better way; whether they are similar or not; whether they are easy or not.

* What's going to happen?

I'm going to update this README at every stage of development, laying out a plan for the next step and evaluating the one i've just completed.  Any time I deviate from that plan I'm going to update the README to reflect that-- what've i've done differently and why.  Once the project is complete I hope to have a map showing where I got hung up, what strategies worked, what helped and what wasted my time.  

The point here is learning. I'll be completing this project during downtime and free time so it may take many more days to complete, but the hope is that it will take fewer total working hours and give me a roadmap for the future.

I think that's about it so lets dive in.

* Prologue-- what came before

-I submitted my eats project about an hour and a half ago.
-I spent roughly 17 hours on the project, minus time spent on breaks, eating and travelling to do those things.
-I'm starting from scratch now, i've created all the files I will need and have started a new repository.
-I have access to all the wireframes and user stories from the original project.
-The timer starts as soon as I finish updating the README.
-Time spent planning will count towards total work time.  
-At the end of every session I'll update the README with a running total of time spent.
-This first planning session is a gimme-- it doesn't count towards my time.

Ready?
GO!

* Chapter 1
-I'm going to focus on realizing my wireframes first, rather than creating the data and then trying to put it where I want it.  I'm going to create an HTML skeleton with my framework of choice and try to get as much styling done as possible before I dive into functionality.  
-I'm going to use Materialize to drive the CSS.
-I'm going to cull and sort my user stories to reflect my first point of focus and complete those tasks in their entirerty before moving on to more functional code.
Lets see how this goes!
Time to complete 1 hr
Using a framework to predefine where content would go saved a lot of headaches and rolled everything together nicely.  I found that user stories couldn't be fully separated from the layout process so I completed content tasks as they made sense.  I also found that it made the most sense to lay out one page before moving on to the next, filling in content as I went.
I think this would work differently if there were difficult design tasks on the first page I began working on so

Rule 1: design first, add content as it makes sense to do so.  Focus on the easy tasks first
